                <h1>Bill Gates Invests Big in So-Called 'Clean' Air Conditioning Startup</h1>
                <small>August 01, 2022</small>
                <p>
                <h5>Blue Frontier claims that their new AC technology could reduce energy consumption by 90%.</h5>
                <p>The path to creative climate solutions is paved with the skeletons of a million startups, but Blue
                    Frontier wants to be different. Blue Frontier is chasing the dream of cleaner air conditioning
                    systems with its use of a concentrated salt solution, and results are so promising that the company
                    just got a big check from Bill Gates.</p>
                <p>In the dog days of summer, most of us try to gravitate to an air conditioned place to beat the heat,
                    but the issue with our modern AC technology is actually twofold. One, it’s dirty—air conditioners
                    are energy intensive and can emit greenhouse gases like hydrofluorocarbons and carbon dioxide. Two,
                    as climate change continues to make episodes of heat more frequent, we are going to keep having to
                    rely on this dirty air conditioning to keep us comfortable. Enter: Blue Frontier.</p>

                <h1>Intel Lost Nearly $500 Million In Brutal Second Quarter</h1>
                <small>July 13, 2022</small>
                <p>
                <h5>Executives at the company cited lower demand for PC components and rising inflation as primary
                    reasons for the decline.</h5>
                <p>Intel could really use a few bucks from the recently passed (by Congress, at least) $280 billion
                    CHIPS and Science ACT. The U.S. chipmaker shocked investors on Thursday, revealing it lost nearly
                    $500 million in Q2, its first quarterly loss in years. The company cited weakened demand for PC
                    components and downturns in the broader economy as the main culprits for the declines.<br>

                    Overall, Intel’s revenues were down 22% year over year. Those results have forced Intel to lower its
                    expected yearly revenues down from $68 billion to $65 billion. Yikes.</p>
                <p>Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the results were “disappointing.”<br>

                    “This quarter’s results were below the standards we have set for the company and our shareholders,”
                    Gelsinger said. “We must and will do better. The sudden and rapid decline in economic activity was
                    the largest driver, but the shortfall also reflects our own execution issues.”<br>

                    He continued. “We are being responsive to changing business conditions, working closely with our
                    customers while remaining laser-focused on our strategy and long-term opportunities. We are
                    embracing this challenging environment to accelerate our transformation.”</p>
